Unraveling Ariadne’s Thread of Logicogeometry

This is an attempt to provide scaffolding for a project I have in mind which could be pursued profitably by someone who wants to get a deep understanding of geometry ∩ logic ∩ UI design ∩ development.

I might conduct this project at some point later in my life but flushing out the details here so if either some fellow knowledge seeker or my future self decides to explore this territory, they have a decent pool of resources to help them on their course.

I aim to focus and integrate the research I have been doing in [[https://github.com/prathyvsh/history-of-logic][the past couple of years in the proximate areas]] to chart useful resources: learning materials, inspirations, literature, prior art etc. that might be helpful to pursue this project.

I have collated a few resources to share in roughly these topics: geometry, logic, UI, development. This is the motif/coordinates using which I will locate these resources. I will highlight one/more parts of this quadrant if the shared resource belongs to it/them.

The idea for this thread was spurred on when I read about how Spinoza presented his work Ethics using the Geometric Method. He used it to demonstrate how human reason follows eternal laws just like how nature does.

Spinoza’s architectonic project was directed towards achieving a disinterested vantage point from which to understand human reason so as to understand the necessary and sufficient conditions as if from the point of view of eternity: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_specie_aeternitatis

This indeed resonates with the view of God as a geometer who had “adequate” knowledge of how reality was constituted in its multifarious aspects. This is a great read on why the geometric method constitutes the very marrow of rationalist philosophy: https://iep.utm.edu/geo-meth/
